## Skills Learned
Throughout the development of **Dream Plots**, I've expanded my expertise as a game developer in many key areas, further demonstrating my growth and adaptability in the evolving landscape of game development:

- **Mobile Compatibility**: Mastered the adaptation of gameplay for mobile devices, addressing unique challenges such as building mechanics without a mouse and ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- **Data Saving for Models/Assets**: Developed methodologies for saving complex data related to models and assets, including their rotation, position, styles, etc., ensuring a seamless and persistent game world.
- **Loading and Managing Asset Data**: Enhanced my skills in efficiently loading assets along with their position, rotation, and other relevant data, providing a dynamic and responsive gameplay environment.
- **Sharing and Collaborative Data Management**: Learned how to manage and share saved game data among players to facilitate features like team building and collaborative projects within the game.
- **Time and Timezone Synchronization**: Acquired the ability to sync game events and environments with real-world time and player timezones, adding a layer of realism and immersion.
- **Advanced UI Design**: Elevated my knowledge in UI design, focusing on creating more complex and user-friendly interfaces that enhance player interaction and game aesthetics.
- **Advanced Hit Boxing**: Gained expertise in advanced hit boxing techniques, allowing for more precise and realistic interactions within the game environment.

These skills not only reflect the technical aspects of game development but also underscore my commitment to creating accessible, engaging, and innovative gaming experiences that cater to a wide audience.

**Dream Plots** combines these features to provide a deeply engaging and endlessly creative gameplay experience, setting new benchmarks for innovation and player freedom in the gaming world.

## Why No Source Code?

The decision to withhold the source code stems from the nature of Roblox game development. Open sourcing a Roblox game can inadvertently expose it to potential theft and server-side exploitation, compromising the game's integrity and player experience.

My priority is to maintain a secure and enjoyable environment for all players, and thus, I've opted to keep the code private. This README aims to provide a clear understanding of the project's scope, objectives, and my personal contributions.
